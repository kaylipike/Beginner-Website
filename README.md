## Overview

This project is a multi-page responsive website about China, created as the final assignment for an introductory web development course.
The site explores China’s culture, geography, and history through a clean, user-friendly interface. It’s built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and PHP, marking my first experience with web programming.

## Development Process

Before creating this final website, I spent the semester developing a project on Climate Change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Through that process, I learned and implemented:

1. Structuring pages with HTML
2. Enhancing visuals with CSS
3. Making layouts responsive
4. Adding interactivity and data with PHP and databases
5. Iteratively refining design, usability, and accessibility (considering user intuitivity, color schemes, and more)

The China website is the culmination of all these skills, combining design, interactivity, and structure into a fully responsive site.

## Project Structure

Each page follows a consistent layout:

* **Header:** Title and navigation bar
* **Main Content:** Text, images, and links
* **Footer:** Sitemap and site Home Page links

## Reflection

This project represents a major milestone in my learning journey. It’s my first complete, independently developed website and demonstrates my ability to apply front-end and back-end web technologies cohesively.
